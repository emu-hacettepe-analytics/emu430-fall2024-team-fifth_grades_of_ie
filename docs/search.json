    "text": "Time Series Analysis\n\nSeasonal Analysis\nThe purpose of this analysis is to perform seasonal analysis for multiple economic indices and visualize their monthly patterns in a faceted plot.

Here’s an interpretation of each index based on the graph’s trends:\nEconomic Confidence Index: The index significantly drops close to April (Month 4), with a gradual ascent up to December. This suggests a seasonal dip, potentially due to external economic or market-specific causes that stabilize later in the year.\nConsumer Confidence Index: The index shows a relatively stable trend but retreats slightly in the middle of the year, especially over the summer months. In this regard, consumer confidence is susceptible to financial challenges or changes that may occur mid-year.\nReal Sector Confidence Index: There is a sharp fall around April that almost mirrors the trend in the Economic Confidence Index, suggesting a link with broader economic trends and real-sector activity levels. The bounce-back in the latter part of the year implies improved performance or resolution of early challenges.\nServices Confidence Index: Confidence exhibits a marked drop early in the year but then sees a strong recovery through the remainder of the year, exhibiting steady growth. This may indicate seasonal variation in service demand.\nRetail Trade Confidence Index: The retail index also mirrors a similar trend as that of the Services Index—a slump in the early months followed by a steady climb upward. This aligns with consumer behavior, where retail activity picks up after initial low seasons.\nConstruction Confidence Index: The most pronounced seasonality is observed here, with a slump in March-April (Months 3-4) and then a recovery that plateaus in the second half of the year. This may be due to seasonal influences, like weather conditions affecting construction activities.\nIn conclusion, dips in the indices around the beginning of the year, especially March-April, indicate sector-wide impacts, possibly due to seasonal slowdowns or economic cycles. Recovery toward the end of the year in most indices suggests either resilience or increased activity due to year-end planning and execution. These trends can guide strategic planning and help businesses prepare for periods of low confidence and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n \n\n\nYearly Analysis\nThe purpose of this code is to perform a yearly analysis for multiple economic indices and visualize their annual trends using a faceted plot. It helps to identify how each index changes year by year, providing insights into long-term trends and patterns.\nCheck the following codes for the yearly analysis line charts:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Import the dataset\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"Cleaned_Economic_Confidence_Index_Dataset.csv\")\n\n# Exclude 'Year' and 'Month' columns (~ AI ~)\ncolumns_to_analyze &lt;- setdiff(names(data), c(\"Year\", \"Month\"))\n\n# Perform yearly analysis for all columns except 'Year' and 'Month'\nyearly_analysis &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(all_of(columns_to_analyze), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n# Reshape the data for faceted plotting\nmelted_data &lt;- yearly_analysis %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Index\", values_to = \"Yearly_Average\")\n\n# Set the order of facets to match the order in the Excel file (~ AI ~)\nmelted_data$Index &lt;- factor(melted_data$Index, levels = columns_to_analyze)\n\n# Plot using faceting with vertical x-axis labels for yearly analysis\nggplot(melted_data, aes(x = Year, y = Yearly_Average)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Index), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Index, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Yearly Analysis of All Indices\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Yearly Average\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(data$Year)) + # Ensure all years are shown (~ AI ~)\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1) # Rotate x-axis labels\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe yearly analysis of six confidence indices reveals key trends and sectoral distinctions, providing valuable insights into the broader economic landscape. Across all sectors, a general decline is observed from 2011 to 2020, with 2020 marking the lowest point due to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recovery patterns vary across sectors, highlighting their unique dynamics and resilience.\nThe Economic Confidence Index and Consumer Confidence Index both exhibit a steady downward trend over the years. While the Economic Confidence Index shows a slight stabilization after 2021, the Consumer Confidence Index maintains a relatively lower and flatter trend post2020, indicating continued challenges in restoring consumer sentiment.\nThe Real Sector Confidence Index shows more pronounced fluctuations compared to other indices, with brief recoveries in 2017-2018. However, it experiences a sharp decline in 2020, followed by a gradual downturn in subsequent years. Similarly, the Construction Confidence Index follows a steady and significant decline from 2011 to 2020, with a modest recovery post2021 that remains below historical levels, reflecting structural weaknesses in the sector.\nAmong the indices, the Services Confidence Index displays a marked recovery after the sharp dip in 2020, indicating a higher level of adaptability and resilience in this sector. In contrast, the Retail Trade Confidence Index showing smaller fluctuations compared to other indices. However, its recovery after 2020 remains modest and less pronounced compared to the services sector.\nThe pandemic’s impact is most evident in 2020, where all indices reached their lowest points, but the recovery paths diverge significantly. The services sector shows the fastest recovery, underscoring its resilience, while the construction sector struggles to regain momentum. The overall trends highlight the importance of tailoring sector-specific policies, with a focus on supporting struggling sectors like construction while leveraging the recovery potential of resilient ones like services. This comparative analysis offers a comprehensive basis for informed policymaking and targeted economic strategies in the post-pandemic era."

We will follow two main analysis in our project:\n\nTime Series Analysis\n\nObjective: To examine how the Economic Confidence Index and its sub-indices have changed over the years and months.\nMethod:\n\nLine Charts: Visualize the trend of each index over time.\nSeasonal Analysis: Identify any recurring patterns in the indices monthly.\nYearly Comparisons: Analyze the increases or decreases on an annual basis.\n\n\nComparison of Indices\n\nObjective: To identify how the Consumer, Real Sector, Services, Retail Trade, and Construction Confidence Indices differ from each other and the Economic Confidence Index.\nMethod:\n\nCorrelation Analysis: Measure the relationships between the sub-indices.\nBar Charts: Visualize comparative representations of indices for specific years.\n\n\n\nTime series analysis and comparison of sub-indices can provide significant insights into economic confidence. Through time series analysis, long-term trends, seasonal effects, and the impact of economic events on the indices can be identified; for instance, sudden declines during crises or increases during periods of growth may become evident. This analysis can reveal periods of greater stability or volatility in economic confidence through yearly comparisons. Comparing sub-indices allows for examining relationships, correlations, and differences across sectors. For example, insights can be gained on the alignment between consumer confidence and real sector confidence or the sensitivity of the construction sector to economic fluctuations. These analyses support a better understanding of economic health, the development of policy recommendations, and the optimization of investment strategies. In particular, examining the trends of indices over time and the dynamics between sectors can deliver valuable insights to guide economic decision-making processes."

To prepare the data for analysis, we deleted the first three rows from the raw data.\n\n\n\nIn our analysis, we decided to focus on the economic confidence index and its sub-indices confidence indices. So we just kept the first eight columns.\n\n\n\nTo clarify and tidy our data set for importing into R, we simply copied and renamed the columns. We deleted the rows containing NA (-) values, resulting in the loss of data from 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. We continued our analysis with the years between 2011 and 2024."

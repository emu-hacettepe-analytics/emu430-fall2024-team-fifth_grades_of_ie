    "text": "Our analysis will be be based on the data set Economic Confidence Index set published by TUIK. The ECI reflects the general sentiment towards the economy and is composed of various sectoral indices. The dataset spans from 2011 January to 2024 October and provides information on the following indices:\n\nEconomic Confidence Index: Represents the overall economic outlook by combining data from multiple sectors.\n\nIn the below, you can see the distributions and value types of the datas. We fou\n\nMeaning: The date when the data was recorded.\nVariable Type: data wa\nVariable Type: Numeric\nValue Distribution: This column will contain a range of dates from 2007 to 2024, likely with monthly intervals.\n\nIn the below, you can see the distributions and value types of the datas. We fou\n-   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)\n\n-   **Value Distribution**: The values typically range from 0 to 200, with a midpoint of 100, where values above 100 indicate optimism and values below 100 indicate pessimism.\n-   **Value Distribution**: Normal Distribution\n\nConsumer Confidence Index (CCI)\n\nMeaning: A measure of consumers’ confidence about their financial situations and expectations for the economy.\nVariable Type: Numeric (Continuous)\nValue Distribution: Similar to ECI, values generally range between 0 and 200, with a neutral point at 100.\nValue Distribution: Normal Distribution\n\nReal Sector Confidence Index (RSCI)\n\nMeaning: Reflects confidence within the real sector, such as production levels, investments, and employment trends in manufacturing.\nVariable Type: Numeric (Continuous)\nValue Distribution: This index may fluctuate depending on economic conditions, with typical values ranging between 0 and 200, and a neutral value around 100. The subcomponents of the RSCI are as follows:\nValue Distribution: Normal Distribution\n\nService Confidence Index\n\nMeaning: Reflects the confidence in the service sector, considering factors like business activity and expectations.\nVariable Type: Numeric (Continuous)\nValue Distribution: Typically ranges from 0 to 200, with a neutral value at 100.\nValue Distribution: Normal Distribution\n\nRetail Trade Confidence Index (RTCI)\n\nMeaning: Represents the sentiment in retail trade, including expectations of sales and stock levels.\nVariable Type: Numeric (Continuous)\nValue Distribution: Generally ranges from 0 to 200, with values above 100 indicating optimism about sales and retail activity.\nValue Distribution: Normal Distribution\n\nConstruction Confidence Index (CCI)\n\nMeaning: Reflects confidence in the construction sector, focusing on current orders and future business activity.\nVariable Type: Numeric (Continuous)\nValue Distribution: Similar to other indices, values typically range between 0 and 200, with a neutral value of 100.\nValue Distribution: Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n#Importing the data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"Cleaned_Economic_Confidence_Index_Dataset.csv\")\n\n# View the first rows of the data\nhead(data)\n\n\n  Year Month Economic_Confidence_Index Consumer_Confidence_Index\n1 2011     1                  113.9178                  94.44739\n2 2011     2                  112.0710                  96.14788\n3 2011     3                  111.4062                  95.92783\n4 2011     4                  111.7184                  95.80490\n5 2011     5                  112.3256                  95.26634\n6 2011     6                  112.8469                  97.96949\n  Real_Sector_Confidence_Index Services_Confidence_Index\n1                        115.1                  131.1788\n2                        111.2                  129.5531\n3                        111.0                  129.7790\n4                        111.2                  129.7248\n5                        112.4                  130.6081\n6                        111.5                  130.8104\n  Retail_Trade_Confidence_Index Construction_Confidence_Index\n1                      131.4756                     105.72869\n2                      131.2104                     103.94691\n3                      127.8964                      95.62805\n4                      127.3728                     103.57658\n5                      125.7602                     104.95503\n6                      128.3933                     105.28451\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculate monthly averages\nmonthly_averages &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Real_Sector_Avg = mean(Real_Sector_Confidence_Index, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# View the calculated monthly averages\nhead(monthly_averages)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   Year [1]\n   Year Month Real_Sector_Avg\n  &lt;dbl&gt;

We will follow two main analysis in our project:\n\nTime Series Analysis\n\nObjective: To examine how the Economic Confidence Index and its sub-indices have changed over the years and months.\nMethod:\n\nLine Charts: Visualize the trend of each index over time.\nSeasonal Analysis: Identify any recurring patterns in the indices monthly.\nYearly Comparisons: Analyze the increases or decreases on an annual basis.\n\n\nComparison of Sub-Indices\n\nObjective: To identify how the Consumer, Real Sector, Services, Retail Trade, and Construction Confidence Indices differ from each other.\nMethod:\n\nCorrelation Analysis: Measure the relationships between the sub-indices.\nBar Charts: Visualize comparative representations of indices for specific years.\n\n\n\nTime series analysis and comparison of sub-indices can provide significant insights into economic confidence. Through time series analysis, long-term trends, seasonal effects, and the impact of economic events on the indices can be identified; for instance, sudden declines during crises or increases during periods of growth may become evident. This analysis can reveal periods of greater stability or volatility in economic confidence through yearly comparisons. Comparing sub-indices allows for examining relationships, correlations, and differences across sectors. For example, insights can be gained on the alignment between consumer confidence and real sector confidence or the sensitivity of the construction sector to economic fluctuations. These analyses support a better understanding of economic health, the development of policy recommendations, and the optimization of investment strategies. In particular, examining the trends of indices over time and the dynamics between sectors can deliver valuable insights to guide economic decision-making processes."

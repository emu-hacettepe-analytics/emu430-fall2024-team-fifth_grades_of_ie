Our analysis will be be based on the data set Economic Confidence Index set published by TUIK. The ECI reflects the general sentiment towards the economy and is composed of various sectoral indices. The data set spans from 2011 January to 2024 October and provides information on the following indices:

-   **Economic Confidence Index**: Represents the overall economic outlook by combining data from multiple sectors.

In the below, you can see the distributions and value types of the datas. We fou

-   **Meaning**: The date when the data was recorded.

-   **Variable Type**: data wa
-   **Variable Type**: Numeric

-   **Value Distribution**: This column will contain a range of dates from 2007 to 2024, likely with monthly intervals.

In the below, you can see the distributions and value types of the datas. We fou

    -   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)

    -   **Value Distribution**: The values typically range from 0 to 200, with a midpoint of 100, where values above 100 indicate optimism and values below 100 indicate pessimism.
    -   **Value Distribution**: Normal Distribution

2.  **Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)**

    -   **Meaning**: A measure of consumers' confidence about their financial situations and expectations for the economy.

    -   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)

    -   **Value Distribution**: Similar to ECI, values generally range between 0 and 200, with a neutral point at 100.
    -   **Value Distribution**: Normal Distribution

3.  **Real Sector Confidence Index (RSCI)**

    -   **Meaning**: Reflects confidence within the real sector, such as production levels, investments, and employment trends in manufacturing.

    -   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)

    -   **Value Distribution**: This index may fluctuate depending on economic conditions, with typical values ranging between 0 and 200, and a neutral value around 100.
    The subcomponents of the RSCI are as follows:
    -   **Value Distribution**: Normal Distribution

4.  **Service Confidence Index**

    -   **Meaning**: Reflects the confidence in the service sector, considering factors like business activity and expectations.

    -   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)

    -   **Value Distribution**: Typically ranges from 0 to 200, with a neutral value at 100.
    -   **Value Distribution**: Normal Distribution

5.  **Retail Trade Confidence Index (RTCI)**

    -   **Meaning**: Represents the sentiment in retail trade, including expectations of sales and stock levels.

    -   **Variable Type**: Numeric (Continuous)

    -   **Value Distribution**: Generally ranges from 0 to 200, with values above 100 indicating optimism about sales and retail activity.

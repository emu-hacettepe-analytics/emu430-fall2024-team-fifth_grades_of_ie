## What is the Data About?

The data set below contains various economic confidence indices and sub-indices for Turkey from 2007 to 2024, including categories such as consumer, services, retail, construction, and real sector confidence indices. This data set offers an in-depth look at economic confidence levels across different sectors in Turkey, with monthly data spanning from 2007 to 2024. It includes indices for consumer confidence, real sector confidence, confidence in services, retail trade, and construction sectors. Each index reflects how people and businesses feel about their economic prospects.

## Reasons for the Selection of This Data Set

We selected that data set because it is very convenient for sustaining the dynamics of the Turkish economy. Confidence indices in the data set provide an important indicator of the fluctuations that the Turkish economy has experienced in recent years and the developments in different sectors. Also, it is large enough to use and perform analysis to get reliable results.

## Objectives and Plans

Our main focus is getting economic insights by analyzing TÃ¼rkiye's economic confidence index and sub-indices. We will follow two main analysis in our project:

-   **Time Series Analysis**

    -   **Objective:** To examine how the Economic Confidence Index and its sub-indices have changed over the years and months.

    -   **Method:**

        -   **Line Charts:** Visualize the trend of each index over time.

        -   **Seasonal Analysis**: Identify any recurring patterns in the indices monthly.

        -   **Yearly Comparisons**: Analyze the increases or decreases on an annual basis.

-   **Comparison of Indices**

    -   **Objective:** To identify how the Consumer, Real Sector, Services, Retail Trade, and Construction Confidence Indices differ from each other and the Economic Confidence Index.

    -   **Method:**

        -   **Correlation Analysis**: Measure the relationships between the sub-indices.

        -   **Bar Charts**: Visualize comparative representations of indices for specific years.

Time series analysis and comparison of sub-indices can provide significant insights into economic confidence. Through time series analysis, long-term trends, seasonal effects, and the impact of economic events on the indices can be identified; for instance, sudden declines during crises or increases during periods of growth may become evident. This analysis can reveal periods of greater stability or volatility in economic confidence through yearly comparisons. Comparing sub-indices allows for examining relationships, correlations, and differences across sectors. For example, insights can be gained on the alignment between consumer confidence and real sector confidence or the sensitivity of the construction sector to economic fluctuations. These analyses support a better understanding of economic health, the development of policy recommendations, and the optimization of investment strategies. In particular, examining the trends of indices over time and the dynamics between sectors can deliver valuable insights to guide economic decision-making processes.

## Preparing the Data for Analysis

-   The original data set contained irrelevant rows at the beginning, such as titles and introductory text. To prepare the data for analysis, we deleted the first three rows from the raw data.

-   In our analysis, we decided to focus on the economic confidence index and its sub-indices confidence indices. So we just kept the first eight columns.

-   To clarify and tidy our data set for importing into R, we simply copied and renamed the columns. We deleted the rows containing NA (-) values, resulting in the loss of data from 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. We continued our analysis with the years between 2011 and 2024.

## Storing the Data in .RData Format

To convert the data into .RData format, we first saved the data as a .csv file. We then imported our data set into R using the "read.csv" function from the "readr" package. After that, we used the "save" function to save our data set as .RData format and uploaded this file to our team's repository on GitHub.

*Check the following codes for the importing process:*

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(readr)
tidy_data <- read.csv("Cleaned_Economic_Confidence_Index_Dataset.csv")
save(tidy_data, file = "Cleaned_Economic_Confidence_Index_Dataset.RData")

```
